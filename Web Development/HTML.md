# HTML

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating and structuring documents on the web. It is the backbone of web development and is used to define the structure and layout of web pages. HTML consists of a series of elements, each represented by tags, which define the various parts of a webpage.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Markup Language:**
   - HTML uses a markup structure, where tags are used to define elements on a webpage.
   - Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and come in pairs (opening and closing tags).

2. **Document Structure:**
   - HTML documents are structured as a tree of elements nested inside one another.
   - The basic structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

3. **Elements and Tags:**
   - Elements are the building blocks of HTML, representing different parts of a document.
   - Tags define the beginning and end of an element. For example, `<p>` defines a paragraph.

4. **Attributes:**
   - HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information about the element.
   - Attributes are usually included in the opening tag and have a name and a value.

5. **Headings and Text:**
   - Headings are defined using `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags, where `<h1>` is the largest and `<h6>` is the smallest.
   - Text content is placed within `<p>` (paragraph) tags.

6. **Lists:**
   - Ordered lists are created with `<ol>` (ordered list) and `<li>` (list item) tags.
   - Unordered lists use `<ul>` (unordered list) and `<li>` tags.

7. **Links:**
   - Hyperlinks are created using the `<a>` (anchor) tag with the `href` attribute.
   - Example: `<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>`.

8. **Images:**
   - Images are embedded using the `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute.
   - Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`.

9. **Forms:**
   - Forms are created with the `<form>` tag, and form elements include input fields, buttons, and more.
   - Common form elements include `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`.

10. **Semantic HTML:**
    - Semantic HTML tags provide meaning to the content, improving accessibility and SEO.
    - Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.

HTML is often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity, creating a comprehensive web development stack. It serves as the foundation for creating web pages that can be displayed in web browsers.

# History of HTML

## Origins (1989-1991)
- The concept of the World Wide Web was proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.
- In 1990, the first web browser "WorldWideWeb" was created, and the first web server was established.
- Tim Berners-Lee introduced the idea of using a markup language to create and link documents on the web.

## HTML 1.0 (1991)
- The first version of HTML, known as HTML 1.0, was published by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.
- Basic tags were introduced, such as `<h1>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, and `<a>` for links.
- The focus was on creating a simple way to structure and link documents.

## HTML 2.0 (1995)
- HTML 2.0 was standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1995.
- It added new features and elements, including tables, forms, and text alignment.
- The concept of attributes in tags was introduced.

## HTML 3.0 (1995, Proposed)
- HTML 3.0 was proposed but never officially released.
- It aimed to include more advanced features such as applets, scripting, and style sheets.

## HTML 4.0 (1997)
- HTML 4.0, released in 1997, introduced significant enhancements.
- Support for scripting languages (JavaScript), applets, and more precise document structure with CSS was added.
- HTML 4.0 also defined the Document Object Model (DOM) for programmatic access to documents.

## XHTML Era (2000s)
- In the early 2000s, HTML development shifted toward XHTML, an XML-based version of HTML.
- XHTML aimed for stricter syntax and compatibility with XML standards.

## HTML5 (2008-2014)
- HTML5, the latest major revision, began development in 2008 and was standardized in 2014 by the W3C.
- It introduced new elements and attributes, including `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<canvas>`, and more.
- HTML5 focused on improving support for multimedia, offline capabilities, and providing a more semantic structure.

## Living Standard (Ongoing)
- HTML is now considered a "living standard" rather than a versioned language.
- The development of HTML continues through the efforts of the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) and the W3C.

HTML has played a pivotal role in the growth of the World Wide Web, providing a standardized way to create and structure content. Its continuous evolution reflects the dynamic nature of the web and ongoing efforts to improve functionality, accessibility, and interoperability.

# HTML Document Structure

## Basic Structure

An HTML document consists of the following main components:

### 1. Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
### 2. HTML Element
<html lang="en">
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</html>
