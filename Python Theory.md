# Tensorflow 
Tensorflow is an open source framework that makes machine learning and neural networking easy to use

# Machine Learing
Machine Learning is a broad field that encompasses various concepts and techniques.

Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enables computer to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. The primary goal of Machine Learning is to allow systems to automatically improve their performance on a specific task through experience and exposure of data 

## Key Concpets
1.  Data: Data make up the foundation of Machine Learning. Models learn patterns and make predictions on historical data.
2.  Features and Labels: In supervised learning, data is divided into features(input) and labels(output).
3.  Algorithms: Mathematical models that learn patterns and relationships from the data
4.  Training: During training phase, models are exposed to dataset with known outcome
5.  Testing and Evaluation: When model is tested on new, unseen dataset to generalise its performance and generalisation to new situations
6.  Prediction or Inference: Once trained, model can be deployed to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data

## Types of Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning
Algorithm is trained on a trained dataset where each data is associated with a corresponding output. The goal is to learn mapping from input to outputs. Example: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
### Unsupervised Learning
Algorithm deals with unlabelled data. The algorithm tries to find pattens, relationships or structures within the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning. Popular algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchial clustering and principal component analysis (PCA)
### Semi Supervised Learning
This approach combines between the element of both supervised and unsupervised learning. It involves training a model on a dataset that contains both labelled and unlabelled data. This approach when getting labelled data is expensive or time consuming. Popular algorithms include self traning and co training
### Reinforcement Learning
It involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacing with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on actions. It is mostly used in scenarios such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems. Common algorithms include: Q learning, deep Q learning and policy gradients.
### Deep Learning
Subset of Machine Learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex representations of data. Neural networks learn hierarchial representations of data making them well suited for tasks such as image and speech recognition. Common deep learning architecture includes convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image processing and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for sequence data.
### Self Supervised Learning
model is trained on the data itself without explicit data labels. It involves creating labels from the data often by creating artificial tasks. Eg. Word Embedding in Natural Language Processing (model predicts missing words in the sentence)
### Transfer Learning
It involves training a model on a certain task and then leveraging that knowledge to perform well on different but related task. This is useful when labelled data for the target task is limited.

## Applications of Machine Learning
1. Image and Speech Recognition: facial recognition, object detection, speech to text conversion. Eg. Siri and Alexa
2. Natural Language Processing: sentiment analysis, chatbot, language translation, text summarisation. 
3. Recommendation Systems
4. Healthcare: disease diagnosis, patient risk prediction, personalised treatmenrt plans
5. Finance: credit scoring, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, customer service
6. Autonomous Vehicles: object detection, path planning, real time decision making
7. Predictive Maintenance: prediction of equipment failures
8. Cybersecurity: intrusion detection systems and malware detection
9. Energy Management: smart grid manaegement, predictive management in energy sector
10. Marketing and Customer Analysis: Customer Segmentation, targeted advertising, churn prediction
11. Agriculture: Satellite imagery from crop monitoring and predicting optimal harvest times
12. Human Resources: applicant tracking systems, predicting employee turnover
13. Climate Modelling: predicting weather conditions patterns, analyzing climate data, modelling environmental changes
