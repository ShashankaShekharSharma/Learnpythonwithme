# A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. It's a dynamic data structure where the size can be changed during runtime. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a fixed amount of memory for storage. Each node in a linked list consists of two parts: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence
# linked lists are a fundamental data structure that provides dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion operations, making them suitable for various applications in computer science and programming.
